<h1>Web Application Frameworks</h1>

Web application frameworks, like Ruby on Rails, support the development of web applications by utilizing content management systems to organize and structure information so that they can be managed with ease and flexibility.

Many frameworks follow the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern to organize and separate responsibilities of the application. 

The Model handles the data and logic including, classes, modules, and databases. The Controller handles the communication between the Model and the View including, handling input, updating the Model, and sending data to the View. The View handles the user interface including, getting input from the user, and displaying data from the Model.

Benefits to using web application frameworks include efficiency, support documentation, and security implementations. Directories are organized by MVC, files are labeled, and tests are included, ensuring that the next person that goes into the project will be able to navigate and test the layers effectively. Knowing where to look for almost any piece of code that may need to be modified, created, or reused makes maintainability more effective and team members more efficient.
